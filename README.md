# FAIL night


Inspired by [PXE](http://ph-neutral.darklab.org/PXE5.txt), this **speakers only** event consists of 5-10 minutes talks without a stage or slides where likeminded hackers can share their stories and have a few drinks in a friendly environment.

We established a minimal, yet non-negligible bar for participation:

* You have to submit a topic related to information security R&amp;D to the organizer before the event.
* Your topic should be about not achieving the originally desired goal, aka. how you FAILED. We understand that great results don't just routinely appear in someone's mind every two months, but if you work hard to stretch your limits you probably have some interesting stories to share.
* You should describe your topic in less than 256 characters. This should be enough for the organizer to get your idea and prevents overload/overflow at both sides.

Evaluation of the submissions must be based on the above points. Positive or negative discrimination based on information other than the received submission contradicts the concept of FAIL night.

## Goals

* Provide an excuse for more or less regular meetups with likeminded geeks
* Provide an opportunity for new people to get involved
* Keep the discussion focused and constructive

## Announcement
* The announcement should be mostly done in analog form. Receiving a "limited edition" flyer is more personal than receiving an e-mail.
* The announcement should include the following:
  * Date of event;
  * Approximate location of the event (city);
  * Contact information for submissions;
    
The announcement must not contain the exact location of the event. This information (possibly with the exact time of meeting) should be distributed among the accepted participants only.

## Execution

* FAIL nights are to be held at places with sufficient amount of drinks and food available.
* To resolve initial tension the organizer is encouraged to order the first round of drinks, then present his/her topic (yes, the organizer must contribute too!).
* Other talks then follow in an agreed order.
* Analogue is preferred. If you need a piece of code or a diagram for illustration, try to make it so simple that you can write/draw it on the back of a napkin by your head.
* If a talk doesn't include a lesson for the audience to learn, the participants are encouraged to find out what the lesson is. Behind every good FAIL there is a lesson!

## Upcoming events

* 2018-04-13 Budapest, Hungary
* You can watch [@hekkcamp](https://twitter.com/hekkcamp) for real-time info.
